# emojinomics

Tool for quick analysis of your SMS/iMessage emoji usage :heart_eyes_cat:

## Requirements
:sunglasses: python  
:sunglasses: iPhone

## What's up

You can print distributions of

:snowflake: your emoji use  
:snowflake: emojis sent to you from a given number.

You can drill down into your emoji distribution a little. Specifically, you can also condition on

:snowflake: the messages you sent to a certain number  
:snowflake: and its complement, all the messages you did not send to a certain number.

## For example

This let's you do fun things like compare

:dog: your emoji distribution to +15556667777, versus  
:dog: +15556667777's emoji distribution to you

(How close is yr emojidistance?)

or

:dog: when sending to anyone except +15556667777, versus  
:dog: when you do send to +15556667777.
